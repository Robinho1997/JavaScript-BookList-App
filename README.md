# JavaScript-BookList-App

https://robinho1997.github.io/JavaScript-BookList-App/

Here I created a Booklist Application where you can enter a bookname, bookauthor and the ISBN number. When you click on the submit button the application saves 
the user-input in localStorage and displays it in a table.

After you saved a book its also possible to remove them after that.

I used vanilla Javascript and a Bootstrap theme called yeti.
